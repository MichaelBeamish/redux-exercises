/* 
  Problem #2
  
  Export a reducer that will increment or decrement the state. It must expect the following action types:
    - INCREMENT
    - DECREMENT
*/

// Theoretically, these action type labels would be imported from an actions file, but we will define them here in this case.
let INCREMENT = "INCREMENT";
let DECREMENT = "DECREMENT";

// Write your code below this line!

let initialState = 0;

export default (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case INCREMENT:
      return state + 1;

    case DECREMENT:
      return state - 1;

    default:
      return state;
  }
};
